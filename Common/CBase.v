(*** Notations ***)


(** Functional pipe notation.

    TODO figure out a correct parsing level. Currently is just below relation so
    that a = b |> f will be parsed as a = (b |> f). *)
Notation "v |> f" := (f v) (at level 69, only parsing, left associativity).

(** Monadic bind with an explicit monad annotation *)
Notation "x ←@{ M } y ; z" := (@mbind M _ _ _ (λ x : _, z) y)
  (at level 20, y at level 100, z at level 200, only parsing) : stdpp_scope.
Notation "' x ←@{ M } y ; z" := (@mbind M _ _ _ (λ x : _, z) y)
  (at level 20, x pattern, y at level 100, z at level 200, only parsing) : stdpp_scope.


(*** Utility functions ***)

(** Convenient iff destruction *)
Definition iffLR {A B : Prop} (i : A <-> B) : A -> B := proj1 i.
Definition iffRL {A B : Prop} (i : A <-> B) : B -> A := proj2 i.

(** Convert a true proposition into a rewriting rule of that proposition to true
*)
Definition Prop_for_rewrite {P : Prop} (H : P) : P <-> True.

(*** Constrained quantifiers ***)

  format "'[ ' '[ ' ∀' x  ∈  b ']' ,  '/' P ']'") : type_scope.

(* The formatting, doesn't work so this is still printed as exists x, x ∈ b /\ P
   but that's not really a problem *)
Notation "∃' x ∈ b , P" := (exists x, x ∈ b /\ P)
