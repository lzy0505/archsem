TODO: clean this up


The Hahn files and base Armv8-A user-mode mixed-size axiomatic model are by Viktor Vafeiadis and subject to the MIT License below.

The arm-v8.5-a-types are subject to the BSD-Clear licence from the Sail snapshot (modulo whatever licences are approprate for the libraries).

The Armv8-A types used from the new Arm ASL are (c), and should in due course be BSD-Clear licenced.

The remaining new material is (c) some subset of Jean Pichon-Pharabod, Peter Sewell, Ben Simner, Alasdair Armstrong, Brian Campbell, and should be BSD 2-clause licensed.
